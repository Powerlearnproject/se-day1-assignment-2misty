# part1 -introduction to software engineering
software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications
importane o software engineering : help manage and simplify complex projects, following the structured engineering principles , sofware engineers canminimize costs, proper engineering practices help manage time

key milesstone in the evolution: the birth  of software engineeering (1968) the termsoftware engineering was coined during the NATO software engineering conference, introductuion of object oriented programming(1980) which revolutionised software design and dev, agile methodologies   emergeged as a response to the limitationof waterfall

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, i.e developing a mobile app where user feedback is continually incorporated to improve the product while waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to project management,i.eDeveloping a medical device where each phase must meet stringent regulatory standards before moving to the next.

software developer roles ; coding,  design, debugging
quality assuarance roles ; testing, bug tracking, automation
project manager roles ; planning, communication, risk management

importance of intergrated development has feature like code completion that helps reduce coding erorrs and improve code quality e.g visual studio, android studio
imprtance of version control - allows multiple developers to work on same project simultaneously e.g git , subversion

common challenges and how to overcome 
rapid advancement - continous learning
colaboration and communication - regular meeting, colaboration tools
limited resources -outsourcing

types of testing and importance
unit testing- testing individual compents of codes such as functioms - early bug detection
intergration testing - focuses on veifying  the interactions  between  different units 
system testing - validates the entire system
acceptance testing - ensures requirement fulfilment

prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to guide generative ai
 importance of prompt engineering
-enhances user interaction
-bridges gap between human and ai
reduces bias and erors

vague ' write about technology'
improved ' write an article on the impact of ai in healthcare, focusing on recent advancement in diagnostic tools.
 the improves prompt specifies the topic and area of focus.
is clear by stating  what aspect of tecnology to cover
is concise  yet detailed to guide the ai effectively
